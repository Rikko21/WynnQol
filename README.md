# WynnQol

## Usage
Requires JSMacros 1.9.1 BETA (or higher). Crashes with 1.9.0
<br>
Full artifact:
https://github.com/JsMacros/JsMacros/actions/runs/8370057228

1. Once JSMacros is installed, open the menu by using the hotkey.
2. Open File Explorer and go to ./minecraft/config/jsMacros/Macros and put the WynnQol folder in there
3. WynnQol has 3 folders that align with the three buttons in the JSMacros menu, Keys, Events, and Services. Currently, I have only made services. 
4. Click on Services, then the + button. Name the service whatever you wish.
5. Then under the File button, click the ./ and navigate to the services folder, and add whichever macro you want to add.
6. Then, click Enable and the Stopped button to get it running.

  Replacement for Wynntils spell macros. 
  <br>
  Much faster than Wynntil macros
  <br>
  Blocks Left and Right click during spell execution so you don't accidentally cast the wrong spell
  <br>
  Keys are binded as default wynntils spells, no way to rebind atm (other than manually changing the code)
  <br>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  Requires commandHandler
=======
  You NEED the spellMacro to be enabled if you want to use /spellmacrodelay for this (i did not make a command handler it's just in spellMacro for now, i'll fix later)
